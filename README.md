Web service for checking the results of the word game.
<br>Web service takes a json object and returns all words that were used correctly in the game.
<br>If the game is finished ahead of schedule with an error in the word, a list will be returned that contains all valid array objects before the error.
<br>If the passed array is empty, an empty array will be returned. An empty string in an array is considered invalid (an error in the word).
